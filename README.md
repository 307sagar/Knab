###`NOTE`
Since the coinmaket api is throwing CORS errors even though I handled it in the clinet code.I have used CORS Unblock extension for Chrome.
Link is here - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en.

Enable this extension to resolve CORS issues, if npt handled on the backend.
